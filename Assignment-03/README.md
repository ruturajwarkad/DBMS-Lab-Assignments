# Assignment 3 – Implementing Data Constraints in MySQL

## 🎯 Objective
This assignment demonstrates the creation of relational tables using SQL with proper constraints like `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, and `DEFAULT` values. The assignment also tests violation scenarios and queries to understand constraint behavior.

---

## 📚 Tasks Covered

### ✅ 1. Database Creation
- `StudentManagement` database is created and used.

### ✅ 2. Tables Created
- `3_courses_287` with constraints: `PRIMARY KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `DEFAULT`
- `3_students_287` with constraints: `PRIMARY KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `FOREIGN KEY`

### ✅ 3. Data Inserted
- Sample records inserted into both tables.

### ✅ 4. Constraint Violations Tested
- `NOT NULL` violation
- `UNIQUE` constraint violation
- `FOREIGN KEY` violation

### ✅ 5. SQL Queries Performed
- Filtering by date
- Updating records
- Deleting based on condition
- Checking for null foreign key values
- Re-testing `UNIQUE` and `FOREIGN KEY` constraints
